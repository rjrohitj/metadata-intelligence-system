## Metadata Intelligence System

This repository explores patterns for building, validating, and monitoring
metadata ingestion pipelines in a production-like environment.

### What this project focuses on
- Ingesting structured metadata from multiple sources
- Applying validation and evaluation rules
- Tracking data quality and operational health
- Generating enriched outputs for downstream systems

### Why this exists
The goal is to better understand how large-scale data systems can be made
more reliable, observable, and maintainable over time.

### Scope
- System design and evaluation logic
- Automation and reliability patterns
- Not focused on model training or ML research
